	Dear Recruiting Team,
	
	I am writing to express my interest in the Systems Engineer I position I found on Honeywell’s careers page. I recently graduated from Arizona State University with a bachelor’s degree in Aerospace Engineering. I’m especially drawn to this opportunity because Honeywell works on cutting edge technology in both the space and aviation sectors, both of which I am genuinely passionate about! Collaborating with Honeywell engineers would allow me to contribute my existing skills while continuing to grow technically.
	
	I gained relevant experience through my role at RTX Collins Aerospace, where I interned as a Project Engineer for aircraft evacuation systems in the summer of 2024. Due to my performance, I was invited to stay on full time, where I now conduct validation efforts for outdated testing standards and revise them to meet current federal and internal material requirements. Much of this work involves coordinating with teams across the company, including our materials group in India, to ensure standards compliance - something I noticed is valued in this role.
	
	I’ve also used RCCA tools to investigate product blemishes found during unrelated product escapes. I assessed whether these abnormalities affected product integrity and delivered recommendations to chief engineers. This required hands-on work and close collaboration with manufacturing and procurement engineers. This is another area emphasized in the job description where I hold experience.
	
	Although my current role has not involved control theory or coding, I am deeply interested in both. I’ve structured my graduate studies in Robotics and Autonomous Systems at ASU around a light course load to ensure they don’t interfere with full-time work since my professional growth remains my top priority.

	My experience in systems engineering is further reinforced through my leadership in my capstone project and NASA competition RASC-AL (Revolutionary Aerospace Systems Concepts - Academic Linkage), in which our collegiate team was selected as a finalist team. In this role, we developed a lunar maintenance and servicing robot in which I worked on GNC and telemetry sub-systems. Our team has yet to present our project (DIANA) to a panel of NASA systems engineers this upcoming June. This is another bit of experience that I believe makes me a good fit for this role and valuable to the Honeywell team.
	
	Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and enthusiasm align with your team’s needs.
	
	Best regards,\\[0ex]
